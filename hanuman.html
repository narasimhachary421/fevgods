     <H4>“श्री हनुमन् विजयते सर्वरोग विनाशनं।<br>

          <h4> <b> Translation: </b>“Victory to Lord Hanuman, the destroyer of all ailments,<br>
            He who is the messenger of Lord Rama and the source of all auspiciousness,<br>
            May he grant refuge to all who seek him.” </h4>
        </P>
        <h4> Hanuman is a divine figure known for his selfless service, immense strength, and unwavering devotion to Lord Rama. He plays a crucial role in the Hindu epic *Ramayana*, where his acts of helping and protection are central to the story's progression.<BR> Hanuman's role as a helper is most notably seen in his journey to Lanka to find Sita, Lord Rama’s wife, who had been abducted by the demon king Ravana. Hanuman's courage and intelligence led him to leap across the ocean to reach Lanka, where he located Sita and reassured her that Rama would rescue her.<br>

            One of Hanuman's most significant acts of help comes when he brings the Sanjeevani herb to save Lakshmana, Rama’s brother, who had been gravely injured in battle. Unable to identify the exact herb, Hanuman lifted an entire mountain and brought it to the battlefield, saving Lakshmana's life.<BR> 
            
            Hanuman's assistance extends beyond physical feats; he is a symbol of spiritual support as well. His strength, humility, and wisdom continue to inspire those who face challenges, seek protection, or are in need of guidance. Chanting his name or reciting the *Hanuman Chalisa* is believed to invoke his blessings for strength, protection, and spiritual growth.</h4>
