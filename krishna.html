            Krishna was born in a prison cell in the city of Mathura, to Devaki and Vasudeva. His birth is said to have occurred in the Dvapara Yuga (the third age in Hindu cosmology), around 5,000 years ago, though the exact historical timeline is uncertain.

        <h4><I><B>The remaining 16,100 wives are often described in the Srimad Bhagavatam and other scriptures as women who were rescued by Krishna from the demon Narakasura. Narakasura, a powerful demon king, had kidnapped 16,100 princesses and imprisoned them in his fortress. After defeating Narakasura, Krishna released these women and offered them his protection. They, in turn, requested to marry him, and Krishna, in his divine compassion, married them all to provide them with honor and social protection, as they had been previously dishonored by the demon.

            The number 16,100 is significant because it reflects the vastness of Krishna's compassion, and the marriage to these women symbolizes the idea that Krishna is the savior and protector of all souls, offering refuge to the downtrodden and oppressed.</B></I> </h4>
    <p> <i>Krishna taught that the true self is eternal and indestructible, distinct from the body and mind. The real self is the atman (soul), which is beyond birth and death. The physical body is just a temporary vessel for the soul.</i><p> </center>
